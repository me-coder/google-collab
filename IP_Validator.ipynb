        "### IPv4\r\n",
        "[IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) was the first publicly used Internet Protocol, which used 4 byte addresses which permitted for 232 addresses.  \r\n",
        "The typical format of an IPv4 address is A.B.C.D, where A, B, C and D are Integers lying between 0 and 255 (both inclusive).\r\n",

        "> To quote from the linked article:  \r\n",
        "  1.  The 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.  \r\n",
        "  1.  Each group is written as 4 hexadecimal digits and the groups are separated by colons (:).  \r\n",
        "  E.g. The address 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329 is an example of this representation.\r\n",
        "  1.  Consecutive sections of zeros will be left as they are.  \r\n",
        "  E.g An IPv6 value such as \"...:0:...\" or \"...:5:...\" is address-wise identical to \"...:0000:...\" or \"...:0005:....\".\r\n",
